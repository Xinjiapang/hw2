what changes in the animation when you renamed the variables? 
  I change the X and Y in fill. The variables become error. After I changed all X and Y, the animation is the same as the original.
What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?
  After I change them to nonsense name, The animation still stay smae.
